## Introduction

This is a project I built for the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. 
The fresh_tomatoes.py file is written by Udacity. The pop_movies.py is written 
by me.

## Instructions

To run this project, it is necessary to have the json and requests libraries installed. They can be installed with pip as follows:

```
pip install json
pip install requests
```

The movies are fetched from The Movie Database (TMDb). It is necessary to have
an API key to fetch the movies. To obtain an API key,

* Sign up on [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup)
* Go to the [Settings page](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) to request
  an API key

Once you have an API key,

* Enter your API key in the pop_movies.py file, where indicated (on line 8)
* Run pop_movies.py
